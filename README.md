# Summer-Operating-System
An operating system that I will be developing during the summer.

# Learning
This operating system is being made, so I can learn about OS developement. I am learning through random articles that I find online.

# Installation
Currently it's very poorly made, where every command is in `run.bat`; however, this requires:
- GNU Cross Compiler installed on Windows.
- `grub-mkrescue` installed via WSL.
- QEMU installed on Windows.

# Features
- GRUB bootloader.
- Simple terminal.
  - VGA text mode.
  - PS/2 Keyboard controller.
